# Precourse preparations

On top of a thirst for knowledge, a working connection, and zoom, here is what you will need for the course : 

## Software

To replicate the technical condition of today's real-life data analysis, we will perform our computations on a distant HPC cluster.
To access it: 

 * Linux : you can already use your terminal
 * macOS : you should install a terminal which allows X-formarding. We recommend [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
 * Windows : you should install a terminal which lets you do ssh (for instance [mobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)). 

## R 

A basic knowledge of the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) is required to perform most analytical steps after reads have been mapped and quantified : differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, over-representation analysis.
