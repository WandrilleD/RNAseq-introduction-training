# Precourse preparations

On top of a thirst for knowledge, and a working connection, here is what you will need for the course : 

As announced in the [course registration webpage](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20210902_IRNAS),
we expect participants to already have a basic knowledge in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques. 

## UNIX

A correct command of UNIX command line is also required to be able to follow this course, given that that the tools used to process sequenced reads use this interface.

If you are unsure about your capabilities or feel a bit rusty, we strongly recommend you spend some time practising before the course : in our experience the more comfortable you are with UNIX, the more you will be able to focus on the RNAseq during the course and the you will profit from it.

You may refer to the [SIB's UNIX e-learning module](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html)

## R 

A basic knowledge of the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) is required to perform most analytical steps after reads have been mapped and quantified : differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, over-representation analysis.

## Software

To replicate the technical condition of today's real-life data analysis, we will perform our computations on a distant HPC cluster.
To access it: 

 * macOS / Linux : you can already use your terminal
 * Windows : you should install a terminal which lets you do ssh (for instance [mobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)). 

Additionnaly, a graphical client for file transfer to and from the distant server can be useful. MobaXterm integrates this functionnality, so if you use it there is not need for additionnal software. 
Otherwise we recommend [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client).
