Quality Control is the essential first step to perform once you have your data as `.fastq` or `.fastq.gz` form.



During this course, we will cover our first contact with the distant cluster and linux command line interface.

 * connect to the server
 * use the command line to perform basic operations on the head node
 * exchange files between the server and your own machine 
 * submit job to the cluster
