# Introduction to RNA-Seq: From quality control to pathway analysis

## Learning outcomes

### General learning outcomes

After this course, you will be able to:


 * Describe advantages and pitfalls of RNA sequencing.
 * Design your own experiment.
 * Perform the downstream analysis using command line software 
 (QC, mapping, counting, differential expression analysis, pathway analysis, etc).
 * Critically assess the quality of your results at each step of the downstream analysis.
 * Detect significantly differentially-expressed genes between conditions.


## Learning experiences

To reach the learning outcomes, we will use lectures and exercises. 
During lectures, do not hesitate to ask any questions as we progress through the slides.
During exercises, you are free to discuss with other participants. 

Exercises are provided with solutions. How you use them to your advantage is up to you.

<!-- Suggestion: point out that the course has pre-requisites, and make a hyperlink to the precourse page. This is bc I suspect some users only look at the homepage... So this would make those requirements more visible. -->
<!-- Overall points Alex wants to talk about: 
1) content could be simplified 
2) slides could be simplified 
3) disconnect bw theory and practical sessions -->
